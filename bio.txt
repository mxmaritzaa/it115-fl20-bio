My name is Maritza Medina, I am currently a YearUp student and I like to consider myself a strong and indpependent person. 
I am proud of a lot of my accomplishment but one of the bigger accomplishments I am proud of is Graduating highschool. 
To me that's just the start of the journey and it makes me proud that its something I was given the opportunity to do and I did it! Although many people don't see it as a big accomplishment I like to celebrate my achivments no matter how big or small. 
Overall I am a very genuine and creative person I love making people happy and love achiving my goals I feel confident and happy about my career journey.
